# Architecture Documentation

## Design Goal
Ensure high availability of the system entry-point and critical infrastructure
services.

## Key Decisions
- Use PCS for infrastructure-level HA
- Separate gateway HA from application orchestration
- Design for cloud networking constraints

## Diagrams
(Architecture diagrams will be added here.)
